# üì∞ News Summarization API

A small **FastAPI** service that fetches articles from **The Guardian Open Platform** and (optionally) summarizes them with the **OpenAI API**. For now, summaries can also be served from sample data while the OpenAI billing policy is undecided.

## üîß Setup

### 1) Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2) Environment variables
Copy the example and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

.env.example
```bash
GUARDIAN_API_KEY=your_guardian_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```


### üîë How to get API keys
Guardian API
Go to: https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/

Sign up / log in, create a Developer key

Put it into .env as GUARDIAN_API_KEY

OpenAI API (optional / currently paused)
Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Create a secret key

Put it into .env as OPENAI_API_KEY


### üß™ Run locally (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Endpoints
GET /guardian
Fetch raw Guardian articles.

```bash
/guardian?q=technology&count=1
```

Response (example):

```json
{
  "source": "guardian",
  "articles": [
    {
      "title": "Example title",
      "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/...",
      "content": "..."
    }
  ]
}

```

GET /summary
Summarize fetched articles (uses OpenAI when enabled).

```bash
/summary?q=technology&count=1
```

```json
{
  "source": "guardian",
  "summaries": [
    {
      "title": "Example title",
      "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/...",
      "summary": "Simplified summary text ..."
    }
  ]
}

```

GET /sample_summaries
Returns hard-coded sample summaries (no OpenAI call). <------ 2025 Jul 26 ver.



## üß™ Standalone unit test (no FastAPI)
You can run the Guardian fetcher directly:

```bash
python app/guardian_client.py

```

Sample output:

```bash

<<< RESPONSE TEXT START >>> {"response":{"status":"ok","userTier":"developer","total":151911,"startIndex":1,"pageSize":1,"currentPage":1,"pages":151911,"orderBy":"newest","results":[{"id":"music/2025/jul/26/king-gizzard-and-the-

```
debug=True will print trimmed fields to keep terminal output readable.
The function always returns articles regardless of the debug flag.



## üì∞ Daily News Summary Generation
This project includes a daily summary feature that fetches and summarizes articles from The Guardian in three categories: technology, climate, and education.

üõ† Run the summary job manually
To fetch and summarize the latest articles, run:


```husb
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/daily_summary_job.py
````


Summaries will be saved as a JSON file under data/, named like:
data/daily_summary_2025-08-01.json

The script will skip execution if a summary for today already exists.

(Optional) You can set USE_DUMMY=true in .env for testing without calling the OpenAI API.

üåê View the summaries in browser
After generating the summary file, you can access the /daily endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/daily

````
This renders the latest daily summaries using the saved JSON.


## üí∞ Token / Cost Control Strategy Before Enabling OpenAI in Production

To prevent excessive API usage and unexpected billing, this project includes a lightweight usage tracker.

üìä Usage Tracking with usage_tracker.json
OpenAI API calls are tracked via a local JSON file:
data/usage_tracker.json

Example content:

```json
{
  "total_cost_usd": 2.14,
  "last_reset": "2025-08-01"
}

```

üîí Monthly Cost Limit
A monthly hard limit (default: $3.00) is enforced in code.

When the cost exceeds the limit, API calls are blocked, and a warning is raised.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Every time a summary is generated using the OpenAI API, an estimated cost (e.g., $0.01) is logged by:

```python
from app.usage_tracker import check_and_log_usage

check_and_log_usage(0.01)
```
The tracker will automatically reset at the start of each month.

## üß™ Testing Without API Calls
For development or offline testing, enable dummy mode by adding the following to .env:

```env
USE_DUMMY=true
This will bypass OpenAI and return placeholder summaries.
```


## üÜï New Features
## ‚úÖ Save Full Articles
The daily_summary_job.py script now saves not only the summaries but also the original full articles retrieved from the Guardian API.

File location: data/daily_full_article_YYYY-MM-DD.json

Contents: Each article includes title, url, bodyText, and other metadata under the fields key.

This allows for later reference or reprocessing of the full article content.

## ‚úÖ Archive Summary by Date (HTML View)
A new archive view is available to browse saved summaries by date using FastAPI and Jinja2 templates.

URL format:
http://localhost:8000/archive/YYYY-MM-DD
(e.g., http://localhost:8000/archive/2025-08-04)

Data source:
Reads from data/daily_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.json

Rendered using:
app/templates/archive.html template

Each article summary is displayed with a link to the original article and its summarized content.

## Audio Playback and Download

For each vocabulary entry, you can play the corresponding MP3 audio directly in your browser or download it for offline use.

- **Play in Browser:** Click the play button to listen to the pronunciation or example sentence.
- **Download MP3:** Click the download icon or link to save the file locally.

> **Note:** The screenshots below are provided for illustration purposes only. The actual user interface may change in future updates.

## üìÑ Docs

See [OpenAI Pricing Notes](docs/cost/openai_pricing_notes.md) for details on token usage and cost estimation.


## Static Type Checking (mypy)
The project includes mypy as part of the CI pipeline,
using a relaxed configuration suitable for rapid prototyping.
Full type annotations are not enforced,
but the setup demonstrates awareness of static analysis and maintainability.

## üß≠ Roadmap

- [x] Token / cost control strategy (moved to `docs/cost/openai_pricing_notes.md`)
- [x] Basic Polly integration & mp3 generation from JSON summaries
- [ ] Better error handling & logging
- [ ] Async summarization & batching
- [ ] Result caching (to avoid repeated Guardian/OpenAI calls)
- [ ] Simple HTML front-end (Jinja2 or Streamlit)
- [ ] Optional AWS Polly voice selection (per user or article)
- [ ] CLI tool to synthesize and preview articles
- [ ] Rate limit safeguards & alerting (OpenAI / AWS)
